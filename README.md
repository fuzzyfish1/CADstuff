The bearingTests are for Chicago Hyperloop, we want to test tolerances for friction fitting bearings on a mockup pod. there are 3 different circles, they have different inner diammeters varied at 28mm, 27.5mm, 27.3mm

The keychain thing preferably clear or black 3mm acrylic, I think I fixed the file this time tho.
